# battleShipProject
The Java code defines a text-based implementation of the game "Battleship," where a player attempts to sink enemy ships on a grid by inputting column coordinates. The game initializes with a specified grid size and turn limit, displaying an introductory message. A loop prompts the player for a column input, updates the game grid based on the player's move, and presents the grid's status along with gameplay results. The loop continues until either all enemy ships are sunk, leading to a victory message with the number of turns taken, or the maximum turn limit is reached, resulting in a loss message.
